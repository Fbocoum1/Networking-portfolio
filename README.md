## 👩‍💼 About Me

I'm a **Networking Systems & Technologies student** at **Olive-Harvey College** (City Colleges of Chicago), graduating **May 2026**. 

I first earned a Financial Accounting Technician diploma from **Institut Universitaire de Gestion (IUG)** in Bamako, Mali, and completed internships at Direction Administrative des Finances and Income Tax Perception. 

After moving to the United States and working while studying on and off, I decided to return to school to pursue my passion for **computer networking**. I currently work part-time as a **Testing Specialist** at Olive-Harvey College and as a package handler at **UPS**.

**Languages**: English, French, Bambara, Poular
