# Networking Portfolio – Fatoumata Bocoum

This repository contains my personal networking portfolio site, hosted with GitHub Pages.

## About Me

I am a Networking Systems & Technologies student at Olive-Harvey College (City Colleges of Chicago), graduating in May 2026. I first earned a Financial Accounting Technician diploma from Institut Universitaire de Gestion (IUG) in Bamako, Mali, and completed internships at Direction Administrative des Finances and Income Tax Perception. After moving to the United States and working while studying on and off, I decided to return to school to pursue my passion for computer networking. I currently work part‑time as a Testing Specialist at Olive-Harvey College and as a package handler at UPS. I speak English, French, Bambara, and Poular.
